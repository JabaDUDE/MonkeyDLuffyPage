# MonkeyDLuffyPage

I practice HTML and CSS with a tribute page to my favorite anime main character.
One of my biggest problems is that I love the background and gives off the perfect 'vibe'
but the text becomes hard to read. I'm not sure what I can do to improve it, everything Ive tried makes it look worse.
/**\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\*\*\***\*\***\*\***\*\***
Update as of 6/10/22

I completely redid my previous design and added JS to the site. Instead of a
background that made it hard to read, I went with colors that are theme'd in the anime,
even though I would like to redo it in the future since it is aesthetically
bad.

However, I am proud that I was able to incorporate JS into the site so that
when you click on the name of a crewmember on the top, a biography of that
crewmember will appear on the page. The biggest challenge was figuring out
how to get the values from the objects I made and getting them to appear on the page.
I originally wanted to have the objects in one array but I had trouble accessing
property values and names, so I ended up separating all the objects to their
respective crewmember. The JS file is a little messy but the fact I got it to work
is a huge accomplishment for me that I am proud of. I will revisit in the future
to work on other aspects.
